# PortfolioProjects
Hello everybody! 

I'm glad to share my personal Projects.

--Project 1:
The first one was created to get some insghits on how Covid's Pandemic was afectting the diferent Countries around the world. In this SQL Project I used a lot of JOIN's and some Data Cleaning technics to get good Visualizations that i've later displayed on a Tableau Dashboard.

--Project 2:
This one was all about the Cleaning Data Process, such getting column text fixed or extracting certain needed text using SUBSTRING and CHARINDEX functions. There is some use of CTE's and Alter Tables to do some extra calculations and populating certaing Columns of previous tables. 

The main objective is to continue developing my SQL skills, so there will be a couple more projects and more coding ;).
